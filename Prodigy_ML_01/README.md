# Task 1:
Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

Data used: https://lnkd.in/gMK5vaw2

# ask Highlights:
1. Implemented a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.
2. Utilized a dataset of housing information to train and test the model
3. Analyzed the relationships between the independent variables (square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms) and the dependent variable (house price)
4. Evaluated the performance of the model using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and coefficient of determination (R-squared)

# What I Learned:
1. How to implement a linear regression model using scikit-learn
2. How to prepare and preprocess data for modeling
3. How to evaluate the performance of a regression model using metrics such as MSE and R-squared
4. How to analyze the relationships between independent variables and the dependent variable
