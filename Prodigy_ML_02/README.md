# Task-2:
Create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.
Dataset :- https://lnkd.in/gijCpZ-7

# Task Highlights:
I recently worked on a project to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase history using K-Means clustering algorithm. Here are the highlights:
1. Dataset: Used the Customer Segmentation dataset from Kaggle, which contains information on customer demographics, purchase history, and behavior.
2. Objective: Group customers into clusters based on their purchase patterns to identify loyal customers, frequent buyers, and potential churners.
3. Approach: Implemented K-Means clustering algorithm in Python using scikit-learn library to identify optimal number of clusters and customer segments.
4. Insights: Analyzed the clusters to understand customer behavior, preferences, and demographics, providing valuable insights for targeted marketing and customer retention strategies.

# What I Learned:
1. K-Means Clustering: Gained hands-on experience with K-Means clustering algorithm, including data preprocessing, feature scaling, and model evaluation.
2. Customer Segmentation: Understood the importance of customer segmentation in retail and how clustering algorithms can help identify high-value customer groups.
3. Data Analysis: Improved my data analysis skills, including data visualization and interpretation of results

# Takeaways:
Customer segmentation is a powerful tool for retailers to understand their customers and develop targeted marketing strategies.
K-Means clustering algorithm is an effective technique for identifying customer segments based on purchase history and behavior.
Data analysis and interpretation are crucial skills for data scientists to extract insights from customer data.
